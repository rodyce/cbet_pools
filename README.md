# CryptoBet CBET pools.

Install npm dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

Then, run Ganache-CLI to be able to run unit tests

```sh
$ npx ganache-cli
```

Lastly, run the unit tests with `truffle`:

```sh
$ npx truffle test
```

Once everything is working fine, proceed to deploy to a network with `truffle migrate`.
By default, `truffle` uses the _'development'_ network configured in the _truffle-config.js_
file. You may also want to use the _--reset_ to force redeployment.

```sh
$ npx truffle migrate --network <network in truffle-config.js file>
```

The target network to perform migration is controlled by the \$NETWORK_NAME environment variable.

For reference regarding more environment variables, consult **.env.example** file. You can set the mnemonics to use when migrating and the _Infura_ keys to perform migrations.

##Â Testing with Ganache
In order to test your development, you may use _Ganache_ by connecting your **MetaMask** to it. You will need a set of predefined addresses with balances in order to test. To do so, follow the next steps:

1. Start Ganache with a set of predefined addresses with balances. Run the **start-ganache-test.sh** script located under the **scripts** directory.

```sh
$ sh scripts/start-ganache-test.sh
```

After running this command you will get a summary with each deployed contract and its deployed address.

2. With your MetaMask connected to the Ganache network, register the _private keys_ by selecting **Import Account** in the MetaMask options accessible by clicking the icon in the upper right corner. The following table contains the private keys and their corresponding ETH address with their assigned balances.

| Private Key                                                        |                ETH Address                 |   Cool |

3. Migrate and deploy the contracts with **truffle**. To do so, run:

```sh
$ npx truffle migrate
```

4. Feel free to experiment. Select the account you want to work with in MetaMask.
